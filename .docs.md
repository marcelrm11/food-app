## dangerouslySetInnerHTML

Using dangerouslySetInnerHTML is a way to render HTML in React, but it is generally not recommended because it can open up security vulnerabilities. Instead, it's usually better to use React's built-in ReactNode type to render content as children.

In the case of rendering HTML content, you can create a separate component that takes in the HTML content as a prop and returns it as a ReactNode. Here's an example:

```typescript
import { ReactNode } from 'react';

interface Props {
  content: string;
}

function HtmlRenderer({ content }: Props): ReactNode {
  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: content }} />;
}
```

Then you can use the HtmlRenderer component to render your HTML content as a child component, like this:

```typescript
<HtmlRenderer content={info.summary} />
```

By doing this, you can take advantage of React's built-in security features while still being able to render HTML content.

## useDebounce hook

```typescript
// <T> is a dynamic type
export function useDebounce<T>(value: T, delay: number = 500): T {
  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState<T>(value);

  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setDebouncedValue(value);
    }, delay);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }, [value, delay]);

  return debouncedValue;
}

// usage
const [search, setSearch] = useState('');
const debouncedSearch = useDebounce(search, 1000);
```

# Kitchenette

[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/marcelrm11/food-app/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/marcelrm11/food-app)

## Description

I have a passion for planning and tracking. I need to cook (almost) every day, and sometimes is difficult to find what to cook. It is also difficult to optimize food waste, and countless times I had to throw away food because it had perished.

If only I had a way to keep track of the food I have and get suggestions of what to cook on the spot, or be able to plan the weekly meals ahead, perfectly adapted to the food I have and to my taste...

That's where Kitchenette will make me happy. It will:

- Keep track of my food storage.
- Remind me when something is about to expire.
- Suggest me recipes to cook based on what I have, what I like and when it will expire.
- Help me with meal plans that optimize grocery shopping and health.
